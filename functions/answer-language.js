/**
 * WHICH LANGUAGE THE SEARCH OVERVIEW ANSWERS IN.
 *
 * The bug this exists for: a customer wrote in to sell two iPhone 13 Pro —
 * eleven lines of English, battery health, no boxes, bought in Vietnam — and
 * got a Thai paragraph back, because both writer prompts ended with the line
 * "ภาษาไทย สุภาพ ลงท้ายด้วยครับ" and nothing anywhere carried a language.
 * Someone who writes that much detail is someone who means to sell; an answer
 * they cannot read ends the conversation there.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT "no Thai characters = answer in English"
 *
 * Thai customers type Latin all day: "iphone 17 pro max", "macbook air m4
 * 256gb", "ipad pro m4 wifi". A character-class test would flip the answer
 * language for a large share of ordinary Thai traffic — a far worse bug than
 * the one being fixed, and one that would arrive silently.
 *
 * So the test asks for evidence of an English SENTENCE, not the absence of
 * Thai: no Thai characters at all, AND at least two distinct English function
 * words. Model names and capacities carry none of those, so a lookup stays
 * Thai however it is spelled.
 *
 * The bias is deliberate and one-directional, the same shape as
 * isQuestionQuery on the website: missing an English question costs one
 * customer an answer in the wrong language, which is exactly what happens
 * today. Reading a Thai lookup as English would hand a wrong-language answer
 * to the majority. When unsure, Thai.
